# Customer Behaviour Analysis
# Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, dashboard development, and reporting.The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them clearly using visualizations and reports to support data-driven decision-making.

# Dataset
1. The dataset is loaded and processed using Python.
2. It contains structured data suitable for analysis and visualization.
3. Initial inspection includes checking data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

# Tools & Technologies
1. Python: Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis
2. Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
3. PostgreSQL: Writing and executing SQL queries for analytical insights
4. Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation
5. Gamma: Presentation (PPT) creation
6. Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: Development environment

# Project Steps
1. Data Loading
    - Imported the dataset into Python using pandas.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Analyzed data distributions, trends, and correlations.
    - Identified missing values and inconsistencies.
3. Data Cleaning
    - Handled missing values and duplicates.
    - Standardized column formats and data types.
4. SQL Analysis
    - Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.
    - Wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions.
5. Dashboard Development
    - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard highlighting key metrics and insights.
6. Reporting & Presentation
    - Created a structured analytical report.
    - Developed a presentation using Gamma to communicate findings clearly.

# Dashboard

- The Power BI dashboard provides:
    - Key performance indicators (KPIs)
    - Trend analysis
    - Category-wise and time-based insights
- Designed for easy interpretation by both technical and non-technical users.
